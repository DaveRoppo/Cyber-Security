## What is IcedID?
IcedID is a sophisticated banking trojan that goes beyond traditional banking threats by incorporating features commonly found in information stealers and modular malware.

By performing web injection on browsers and acting as proxy to manipulate traffic, it steals sensitive financial information, login credentials, and other personal data from infected systems. It then sends that stolen information to a remote server.

IcedID is often distributed through phishing campaigns, malicious email attachments, exploit kits, or other social engineering techniques. Once a system is infected, IcedID establishes a foothold and begins its malicious activities.

Since 2017, IcedID has demonstrated a high degree of adaptability and evolution. It has been observed incorporating new features, updating its infection techniques, and adjusting its tactics to evade detection by security solutions. It is even sometimes used as a delivery mechanism for other malware, making it a part of larger and more complex cybercrime operations.

Given its adaptability and ongoing development, IcedID remains a concern for cybersecurity professionals, and its detection and mitigation require a combination of advanced threat intelligence, endpoint protection, and network security measures. Organizations should stay informed about the latest threats and adopt best practices to defend against evolving banking trojans like IcedID.
