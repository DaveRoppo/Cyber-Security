## About
In this project, I set up Azure Sentinel (SIEM) and connect it to a live virtual machine in Azure which will act as a honey pot. From there, I will observe and log incoming RDP Brute Force attacks from all around the world using a log analytics workspace in Azure. Then, using a custom PowerShell script, I will look up the attackers' geolocation information and plot it on the Azure Sentinel Map.

## Tools Used 
- Microsoft Azure
