## About
In this project, using Microsoft Azure, I set up Microsoft Sentinel (SIEM) and connect it to a live virtual machine (created in Azure) which will act as a honey pot. From there, I will observe and log incoming live RDP Brute Force attacks from all around the world using a log analytics workspace in Azure. Then, using a custom PowerShell script and a geolocation.io API key, I will look up the attackers' geolocation information and plot it on the Azure Sentinel Map.
