*Disclaimer: "While running this program your machine will be extremely vulnerable to attack. You should disconnect from the Internet while using this program. WebGoatâ€™s default configuration binds to localhost to minimize the exposure."*

## About

In this project, I will set up and run OWASP's WebGoat application in a docker container on my [Raspberry Pi 4 running Kali Linux](https://github.com/DaveRoppo/Cyber-Security/tree/main/Linux/Raspberry%20Pi/Kali%20Linux%20Install) to practice offensive security skills in an isolated environment.

## What is WebGoat?

"WebGoat is a deliberately insecure application that allows interested developers just like you to test vulnerabilities commonly found in Java-based applications that use common and popular open source components."

## What is Docker container?

"A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings."

## Installation 

#### Install Docker
```bash
kali@kali:~$ sudo apt update
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ sudo apt install -y docker.io
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ sudo systemctl enable docker --now
kali@kali:~$
kali@kali:~$ docker
kali@kali:~$
```
- Verify docker is installed and working correctly by running the following:
```bash
docker run hello-world
```
#### Install WebGoat
```bash
sudo docker pull cambarts/webgoat-8.0-rpi
```
#### Run WebGoat
```bash
sudo docker run -p 8080:8080 -t cambarts/webgoat-8.0-rpi
```
