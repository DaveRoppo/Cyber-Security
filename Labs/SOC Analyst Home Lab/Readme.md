## What is a Security Information & Event Management (SIEM) Solution?
Security information & event management (SIEM) solutions combine security information management (SIM) and security event management (SEM) to provide real-time monitoring and analysis of events as well as logging of security data for compliance or auditing purposes. Organizations can utilize SIEM solutions to quickly identify security threats and vulberabilities that could potentially disrupt thier operations.

## About
In this project, using Microsoft Azure, I set up Microsoft Sentinel and connect it to a live virtual machine (created in Azure) which will act as a honey pot. From there, I will observe and log incoming live RDP Brute Force attacks from all around the world using a log analytics workspace in Azure. Then, using a custom PowerShell script and a geolocation.io API key, I will look up the attackers' geolocation information and plot it on the Azure Sentinel Map.
