A Malware traffic analysis exercise from a pcap posted on Malware-Traffic-Analysis.net on 2020-05-28 by Brad Duncan featuring Trickbot malware.

## What is Trickbot?
Trickbot is a type of malware that primarily functions as a banking Trojan to steal sensitive financial information from infected systems that typically is distributed through malicious email attachments, phishing campaigns, exploit kits, or malvertising. While Trickbot initially focused solely on banking fraud, it has expanded its targets to include various industries such as finance, healthcare, manufacturing, and critical infrastructure since 2016.

# SCENARIO

LAN segment data:

    LAN segment range:  10.5.28.0/24 (10.5.28.0 through 10.5.28.255)
    Domain:  catbomber.net
    Domain controller:  10.5.28.8 - Catbomber-DC
    LAN segment gateway:  10.5.28.1
    LAN segment broadcast address:  10.5.28.255

 
# QUESTIONS

This month's pcap is a Trickbot infection in an Active Directory (AD) environment where the infection spreads to the Domain Controller (DC).

   ## Based on the Trickbot infection's HTTP POST traffic, what is the IP address, host name, and user account name for the infected Windows client?
   ## What is the other user account name and other Windows client host name found in the Trickbot HTTP POST traffic?
   ## What is the infected user's email password?
   ## Two Windows executable files are sent in the network traffic.  What are the SHA256 file hashes for these files?
