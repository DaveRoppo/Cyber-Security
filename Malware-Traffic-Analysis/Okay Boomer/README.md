### What IP is the Windows host that downloaded a Windows executable file over HTTP?
 10.11.11.203 - We found this information by using the filter (ip contains "This program"). We did this because it is common for EXE and DLL files to contain the line "This program cannot be run in DOS mode." Also, the first two bites of EXE or DLL files show as MZ in ASCII.
