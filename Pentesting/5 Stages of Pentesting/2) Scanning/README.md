# 2) Scanning

- Performed on a much deeper level than simple information gathering
- Much more focused on techonologies at play 
- Sending TCP & UDP packets to the target
- Looking for open ports

## Goals 
- Find open ports
- Discover what software is running on the open port/s
	- What version is the software

# Tools
- *sudo netdiscover * to find all available devices on a network
- *nmap (target)* to scan targets to discover open ports, OS, software versions, etc.
	- One of the most widely used tools in penetration testing
	- Scans only the 1000 most known ports by default
	- Some more comprehensive nmap scans can take up to an hour
	- -sS for Syn Scan
	- -O for OS discovery
	- -sV for version discovery
		- Following version discovery, search the web for known vulnerabilities for that version of the software/service
	- Bypassing firewalls and IDS ("Filtered" ports)
		- -f to send fragmented packets to make it harder for firewalls and IDS to detect 
		- -D RND:# (or specify specific IP addresses) to send # of random decoys IPs to hide your IP address
		- -S (IP address) -Pn -e (your network interface) -g (specify port #) to spoof your source IP address
		- -T (0,1) to scan with IDS evasion
