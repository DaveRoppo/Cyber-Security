## About
These scripts serve as components for establishing TCP communication between networked devices using Python. The TCP Client script initiates a connection to a specified host and port, while the TCP Server script listens for incoming connections on a designated port. Together, they enable bidirectional data transmission and facilitate various cybersecurity tasks such as network analysis, protocol testing, and communication between systems.
