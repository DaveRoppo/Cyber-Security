*Disclaimer: Port scanning someone elseâ€™s network without their permission is a crime. Only scan your own network or one that you are permitted to.*

## What is a port scanner?
Port Scanners are used for determining which ports on a network are open and could be receiving or sending data. Additionally, it is a process of sending packets to certain ports on a host and utitlizing the port's response to identify vulnerabilities. Ports scanning takes place for two reasons: to ensure your servers are secure or to exploit those of someone else. An unnecessarily opened port means vulnerability and a potential security concern. Because of this, port scanners can be used to scan your own network to identify potential gaps in security. 

## What is multithreading?
Multithreading is used to achieve multitasking. Multithreading is defined as the ability of a processor to execute multiple threads concurrently. A thread is a sequence of instructions within a program that can be executed independently of other code. Without the use of multithreading, this python script would run extremely slow, because it will just scan one port after another. With multithreadin, we will allow be able to run multiple scanning functions simultaneously.
