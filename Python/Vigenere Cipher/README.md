## About

In this project, I will attempt to replicate the Vignere Cipher using Python.

## What is The Vigenere Cipher?

The Vigenere Cipher is one of many methods of encrypting alphabetic text. It uses a form of polyalphabetic substitution (any cipher based on substitution, using multiple substitution alphabets). Encrypting the original alphabetic text is accomplised using the Vigenère square/Vigenère table.
